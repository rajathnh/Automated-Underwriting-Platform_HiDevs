=== ROOFING RULES ===
- Any roof with visible sagging, significant curling, or more than 10% of shingles missing is a high risk.
- Roofs older than 20 years are a high risk.
- Metal roofs in good condition are a low risk.

=== ELECTRICAL RULES ===
- Properties with knob-and-tube wiring are an unacceptable risk.
- Electrical panels must be at least 100 amps. Panels below this are a medium risk.
- Visible frayed wires or scorch marks are a high risk.

=== PLUMBING & WATER RULES ===
- Any visible signs of active water leaks or significant water damage stains are a high risk.
